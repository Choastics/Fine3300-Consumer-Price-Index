This assignment processes CPI data from CSV files for Canada and its provinces by cleaning and transforming the data, calculating month-to-month percentage changes using Pandas' `pct_change()` method, and computing annual inflation in services. The code then identifies the province with the highest average month-to-month change and the one with the highest inflation in services.
